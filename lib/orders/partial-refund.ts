/**
 * Shortfall refunds for partially fulfilled orders.
 *
 * When staff bag an order and something is not on the shelf, the customer keeps
 * the rest and is refunded for what they did not get. The math here is the
 * money path, so it is a pure function with no I/O: every caller passes the
 * amounts that were actually charged and gets back the exact cents to refund.
 *
 * Computes incremental shortages. The request handler rejects increases in
 * fulfilled quantity after an adjustment: collecting money again is a separate
 * operation. Durable operation records, rather than this pure math helper,
 * establish whether a refund actually settled.
